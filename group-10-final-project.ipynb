    "**Why did you choose this dataset over others?**<br>\n",
    ">The main reason why we choose this dataset over others was because the dataset is on a topic that we found interesting. This combined with the fact that the dataset contains 20058 points of data with 16 attributes, makes it a very useful dataset for analysis. Another reason we choose to do a dataset on chess rather than something else is the value of data analysis in something as complex as chess. In chess, there is more variation the more moves you make, because of this it is easy to see which moves are better earlier on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the data analysis questions you want to use this dataset for?**<br>\n",
    ">1. Are the chances of winning the game greater if you are playing white? If so, why is that?\n",
    "\n",
    ">2. Does the number of moves affect the outcome of the game? If the number of moves played goes over the average number of moves, what is the most likely outcome of the match? What if the number of moves is below average?\n",
    "\n",
    ">3. How do the following victory statuses correlate with rating? Find the correlation coefficient and determine whether the relationship is strong/weak and positive/negative. What conclusions can be drawn from the data collected?<br>\n",
    ">  a) Checkmate<br>\n",
    ">  b) Resignation<br>\n",
    ">  c) Timeout <br>\n",
    "\n",
    ">4. List the top 5 highest win rate openings, what are their win rates? Do their win rates vary depending on piece colour? List the top 5 players that use the combination of these openings the most, what are their win rates and rating? What conclusions can be drawn from the data collected? \n",
    "\n",
    ">5. What is the relationship between the least and most common chess openings and their play rates? Does the trend indicate increasing or decreasing volatility in victory results? What conclusions can be drawn from the data collected?\n",
    "\n",
    ">6. Is there a correlation between how many variations an opening has and how often it is played? \n",
