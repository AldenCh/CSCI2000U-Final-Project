    "**Why did you choose this dataset over others?**<br>\n",
    ">The main reason why we choose this dataset over others was because the dataset is on a topic that we found interesting. This combined with the fact that the dataset contains 20058 points of data with 16 attributes, makes it a very useful dataset for analysis. Another reason we choose to do a dataset on chess rather than something else is the value of data analysis in something as complex as chess. In chess, there is more variation the more moves you make, because of this it is easy to see which moves are better earlier on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the data analysis questions you want to use this dataset for?**<br>\n",
    ">1. Are the chances of winning the game greater if you are playing white? If so, why is that?\n",
    "\n",
    ">2. Does the number of moves affect the outcome of the game? If the number of moves played goes over the average number of moves, what is the most likely outcome of the match? What if the number of moves is below average?\n",
    "\n",
    ">3. How do the following victory statuses correlate with rating? Find the correlation coefficient and determine whether the relationship is strong/weak and positive/negative. What conclusions can be drawn from the data collected?<br>\n",
    ">  a) Checkmate<br>\n",
    ">  b) Resignation<br>\n",
    ">  c) Timeout <br>\n",
    "\n",
    ">4. List the top 5 highest win rate openings, what are their win rates? Do their win rates vary depending on piece colour? List the top 5 players that use the combination of these openings the most, what are their win rates and rating? What conclusions can be drawn from the data collected? \n",
    "\n",
    ">5. What is the relationship between the least and most common chess openings and their play rates? Does the trend indicate increasing or decreasing volatility in victory results? What conclusions can be drawn from the data collected?\n",
    "\n",
    ">6. Is there a correlation between how many variations an opening has and how often it is played? \n",

If the number of moves played goes over the average number of moves (not including draws), then black is more likely to win.  On the other hand, if the number of moves is below average then white has a better chance of winning.\n",

    ">To obtain this data, I had to first create a list containing the number of turns it took for each condition (white winning, black winning, draw game, total games).  This was achieved by using a filter to create a list of games where the condition is true, then using a for loop to make each element of the list only contain the number of turns.  Finally, I had to get the average turns for each condition, which was done by adding up all of the turns from the list and dividing them by the size of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The first challenge that I came across was trying to create a new list only containing the turns and nothing else.  At first I had trouble accessing only the 'turns' element as I was trying to use functional programming with it.  I eventually solved this issue through using a for loop and accessing the element one by one.  The second challenge I faced was that this new list was a list of strings, so I had to convert the elements into integers in the reduce function.  The final challenge that I faced was that the average turn time for a game that ends in a draw was significantly longer than any other type of game, skewing the data towards longer games.  This was solved by creating a seperate mean of the total turns not including draw games, which gave better insight into which side (white or black) has more of an advantage when it comes to long vs short games."

    "\n",
    ">To find how the following victory statuses correlate with rating, I first had to find the average rating of each victory status.  This was done by applying a filter to get a list only containing games of each specific victory status.  I then used a for loop to turn the list into a list of integers which could then go into a reduce function to add up the ratings. Finally, I divided the ratings by the size of the list to get the mean rating for each victory condition.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The main challenge that I faced was when I tried to compare the results of the three victory statuses.  The first solution that I had was to add in the average rating for all games, however, the total rating of all games includes the ratings from games that ended in a draw.  To fix this I had to change the total_games to include all victory statuses except for draw games."
